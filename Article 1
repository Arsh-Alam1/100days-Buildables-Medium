Summary of learning:
I Started learning from a crash course that contains structured learning about the Git and GiyHub
then i learnerd how to push and setup a repository and learnt how to make token to access repo how 
clone it in my local machine how setup global configurations and all the required concepts then i jumped
into the fundamentals of python where i learned the basic structure and syntax of language and IDE usage
along with advance concepts


Completed Tasks:
1. I made a new repository on Github for this Fellowship 
2. I pushed a python file that can print my name and
my favorite hobbies/ Topics i basically made array to be
printed.
3. I pushed a file of python code that contained 
multiple sub tasks



Challenges Faced:
1.Timeline for these tasks was set too less like the crash
courses were 1 and 4 hours youtube videos i had to stop multiple
times and search relevant things.
2. Had to download multiple resources as time given was too less



How i resolved them:
I managed everything on time i prirotize the sub tasks
I made a clear timetable to achieve these in time
i seeked helped from more easy YouTube toturials to understand the tasks
more in depth


Self Reflection:
I am much comfortable with using Github and i now understand 
all the commands associated more over my conceptual 
understanding is enhanced beacuse of the tasks i implemented
